# Home configuration

I am not sure how this will be used at this moment, it will be something!


# For now
It will have my configuration after just a clean arch linux.
Before using this I have:
	- Created an unprivilledge user
	- Installed openssh, zsh, gmrl-zsh, vim, git and python
	- Configured internet access

# Objectives (possible roles)
- Configure K3S
- Configure an github-runner in kubernetes
